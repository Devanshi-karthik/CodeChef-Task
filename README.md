# CodeChef-Task

This website was made as part of a task for the phase 2 recruitment at CodeChef SRM.

The webpage is based on a project called Studlife that basically has all information that a student would need to know about student life on their campus. Since the aim of the task was focused on responsiveness, I have not added too much imformation to the website. However i have tried to demonstate the same using minimal information on various clubs and fests on campus.
The repository contains all files required to analyze the webpage .

The link to the webpage is : https://devanshi-karthik.github.io/CodeChef-Task/

I have also included a screen recording of the same for easier understanding. The mp4 files will have to be downloaded in order to be viewed.
